# Practical 8 

This repository contains the source code for **Practical 8**, which demonstrates two methods to calculate the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers:  
1. Iterative method  
2. Recursive method  

## Files
- `practical8.c`: Contains the C code for calculating GCD using both methods.


## Compilation:

gcc -o practical8 practical8.c

## Execution:

./practical8


## Output:

Enter the value of a: 6
Enter the value of b: 12
Iterative GCD = 6
Recurssive GCD = 6
